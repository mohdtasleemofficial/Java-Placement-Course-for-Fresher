Its first name was "OAK".
1995: -Between 1991 to 1995 many more people contributed to the design & evolution of java. Bill Joy, Arthur van Hoff, Jonathan Payne, Frank Yilin & Tim Lind Holm were main contributors. JDK Alpha and Beta version was released.
1996: - In January 23, 1996 JDK 1.0 version was released. It was first stable release of java 1997 :- In February 19,, 1997 JDK 1.1 version was released.
1998 :- In December 8, 1998 JDK 1.2 version was released.
2000: - In May 8, 2000 JDK 1.3 version was released.
2002: - In February 6, 2002 JDK 1.4 version was released.
2004: - In September 30, 2004 JDK 5.0 version was released.
2006 :- December 11, 2006 Java SE 6 version was released.
2010 :- The acquisition of Sun Microsystems by Oracle Corporation was completed on January 27, 2010
2011 :- In July 28, 2011 Java SE 7 version was released.
2014: - In March 18, 2014 Java SE 8 version was released.
2017 :-In September 21, 2017 Java SE 9 version was released

What is Java ?

1-Programming language: Java is a High Level Programming Language. It derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
2-Platform: Java is a Platform because it has its own runtime environment that is JVM (Java Virtual Machine.

Use of Java

1. ANDROID APPS
2. FINANCIAL
3. JAVA WEB
4. SOFTWARE TOOLS
5. BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES 6. SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS 7. J2ME APPS
8. EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

JDK (Java Development Kit):
Java Developer Kit contains tools needed to develop the Java programs, and JRE to run the programs. The tools include compiler (javac.exe), Java application launcher (java.exe), Applet viewer, etc. JDK is mainly targeted for java development. i.e. You can create a Java file (with the help of Java packages), compile a Java file and run a java file.
JDK = JRE + Development Tools
JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
Java Runtime Environment contains JVM, class libraries, and other supporting files. It does not contain any development tools such as compiler, debugger, etc. Actually JVM runs the program, and it uses the class libraries, and other supporting files provided in JRE. If you want to run any java program, you need to have JRE installed in the system.
JRE = JVM + Java Package Classes + Runtime Libraries
JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
JVM is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed. JVMâ€™s are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM is platform dependent because configuration of each OS differs and this makes java Platform Independent.
JVM performs following main tasks:
1-Loads code 
2-Verifies code 
3-Executes code
Provides runtime environment Libraries
JVM provides a platform which accepts the byte code and executes on the machine.
